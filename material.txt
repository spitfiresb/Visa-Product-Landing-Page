Visa Agent Identity Token (AIT) for Agentic Commerce 

Executive Summary 

AI agents will increasingly handle transactions on behalf of users. Visa needs standardized identity and authorization data to protect all parties and prevent fraud. The Agent Identity Token (AIT) is a data package that Visa will require in agent-initiated transactions for them to qualify for Visa's protection programs. 

Visa won't create or manage the AIT lifecycle. Open protocols like Google's Agent Payments Protocol (AP2) will generate and transmit this data. Visa will specify what information must be present, validate it during authorization, and use it for fraud detection and dispute resolution. 

 

What is the Agent Identity Token (AIT)? 

The AIT is a structured data package with information about agent-initiated transactions. It functions as a digital "passport" that proves: 

Which agent made the purchase 
Who authorized the agent to act 
What the agent was allowed to do 
Evidence that the purchase matches the authorization 
AIT Data Structure 

Identity & Provenance 

Agent ID – Which specific agent made the transaction 
Parent User/Account ID – Who owns/controls this agent 
Developer/Platform ID – Which company or platform created the agent (e.g., Anthropic, Google, OpenAI) 
Agent model/version – What AI model and version the agent is running 
Authorization Evidence 

Authorization scope – What actions the agent was allowed to perform 
Spending limits – Maximum amount the agent was authorized to spend 
Time window – The period when the agent was authorized to transact 
Transaction Details 

Timestamp of purchase – When the transaction occurred 
Merchant category – What type of business received the payment 
Transaction amount & currency – How much was spent and in what currency 
Cryptographic Proof 

User signature – Cryptographic proof the user authorized this purchase 
Merchant signature – Cryptographic proof the merchant committed to fulfill the order 
Integrity hash – Ensures the AIT hasn't been tampered with 
 

How Visa Receives AITs 

Visa doesn't generate AITs—open protocols like AP2 create them. Here's the workflow: 

AIT Lifecycle 

User Authorizes Agent → Protocol (e.g., AP2) creates user authorization record with spending limits and time window 
Agent Shops → Agent finds products and builds cart with merchant 
User Approves Purchase → Protocol creates AIT with full transaction details and signatures 
AIT Submitted to Visa → Issuer or merchant includes AIT in authorization request to Visa 
Visa Validates → Visa checks signatures, spending limits, time windows, and fraud patterns 
Authorization Decision → Approve, decline, or challenge based on AIT data 
Validation Points 

Visa validates AITs at three moments: 

Authorization (Real-Time) – Validate signatures, check spending limits, perform fraud scoring 
Clearing (Batch) – Store AIT for dispute evidence, aggregate fraud patterns 
Disputes (On-Demand) – Use AIT as evidence to determine liability

Business Value for Visa 

1. Capture the Agentic Commerce Wave 

Market Opportunity: As AI agents become more capable, they will handle an increasing share of consumer purchases. Without a framework like the AIT: 

Transactions may migrate to non-card payment methods (crypto, direct bank transfers) 
Visa loses relevance in the next generation of digital commerce 
Competitors who establish agent payment standards first will dominate 
Visa's Play: By defining AIT requirements now and integrating with established protocols like AP2, Visa ensures card payments remain the preferred method for agent transactions. 

2. Premium Fraud Protection Product 

New Revenue Stream: Visa can offer tiered protection based on AIT compliance: 

Basic: Transactions without AITs processed as standard e-commerce 
Visa Agent-Protected: Transactions with valid AITs get enhanced fraud protection and lower dispute rates 
Merchants may be willing to pay premium fees for agent-protected transactions that offer better fraud outcomes and faster dispute resolution. 

3. Unique Network Intelligence 

Data Moat: Visa will be the only entity with cross-platform agent transaction data: 

Which agents (Claude, Gemini, GPT) generate the most transaction volume 
Which merchants are optimized for agent purchases 
Fraud patterns across different agent platforms 
Spending behavior by agent type and user demographic 
Monetization: 

Sell anonymized insights to merchants about agent purchasing behavior 
License data to agent platforms for model training 
Consulting services for merchants entering agent commerce 
4. Competitive Differentiation 

vs. Mastercard/Amex: First to market with comprehensive agent transaction protection 

Visa-certified agents could get preferential authorization approval rates 
Clear liability protection for all parties 
vs. Alternative Payment Methods: 

Crypto and direct bank transfers lack fraud protection and dispute resolution 
AITs make card payments more trusted for agent transactions 
Protects Visa's payment volume from disintermediation 
5. Reduced Fraud Losses 

Current State: Agent transactions without identity verification pose fraud risks. Agents could be compromised, exceed authorization, or be used by bad actors. 

With AITs: Visa can validate authorization in real-time: 

Signature validation catches unauthorized transactions at authorization 
Cryptographic evidence resolves disputes faster 
Lower chargeback rates make merchants more willing to accept agent payments 
6. Strategic Platform Relationships 

By integrating with protocols like AP2, Visa builds strategic partnerships with: 

Agent platforms (Anthropic, Google, OpenAI) – Visa becomes embedded in their payment flows 
Tech giants (Google, Microsoft) – Joint go-to-market for agent commerce solutions 
These relationships create ecosystem lock-in and position Visa as the infrastructure provider for the agentic economy. 

Competitive Advantage 

Why This Benefits Visa Strategically 

Network Effects: As more merchants adopt AIT-compliant checkout, more agents integrate with Visa, attracting more merchants (flywheel effect) 

First-Mover Advantage: By aligning with AP2 early, Visa can establish the standard before competitors 

Revenue Growth: 

Premium fees on agent-protected transactions 
Data licensing to agent platforms 
Consulting revenue from merchants optimizing for agents 
Risk Reduction: 

Lower fraud rates protect Visa's reputation 
Faster dispute resolution reduces operational costs 
Clear liability framework reduces legal ambiguity 
Strategic Positioning: Visa becomes the trusted infrastructure provider for the agentic economy, just as it did for e-commerce in the 1990s. 

Conclusion 

The Agent Identity Token is Visa's strategic play to own the infrastructure of agentic commerce. By mandating standardized identity and authorization data for agent transactions, Visa: 

Protects its payment volume from disintermediation to alternative payment methods 
Creates a premium revenue stream from agent-protected transactions 
Builds a unique data moat with cross-platform agent intelligence 
Reduces fraud risk in agent transactions 
Establishes strategic partnerships with agent platforms and tech giants 
The AIT doesn't require Visa to build new infrastructure. It uses existing open protocols while positioning Visa as the trust layer for the agentic economy. This is Visa's opportunity to lead the next generation of digital commerce, just as it did for e-commerce 30 years ago. 

The question isn't whether agent commerce will happen. The question is whether Visa will be the network that powers it.
